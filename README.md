# Aliens-Love-Toast

### A Brief Introduction:

Aliens Love Toast is the spiritual sucessor to a game of the same 
name which I made in 72 hours for a solo game jam. It was not 
very good. However! I've learned a lot since then, and acquired some
new tools, and I think I can do a lot better. This game will be a 
point and click puzzle adventure game where you make breakfast 
for aliens and get caught up in interstellar hijinks.

If I've done my job right, this game will be funny and enjoyable to play.

### The Project:

While I don't have any hard and fast deadlines in place yet, I would
like to finish this game at some point, and as such I have
limited the scope of this project to hopefully prevent burn out.
Here is a list of tasks which I will mark off as I complete them
so you can track my progress if you want. I will have more in-depth
checklists behind the curtain, but this list is long enough as it
is, so these are the broad strokes:
